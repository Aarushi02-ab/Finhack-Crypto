# Finhack-Crypto
The proposed software product is liable to meet the required security needs of banking applications and other financial crimes. The project would contain certain widgets like login and create an account which has more functionality like security pin generator etc. 
After the security pin is generated it would get stored in the database. As the security pin is an important part of any financial, it needs to be preserved. 
Now coming to the Cryptography application, the security pin would be fetching the security pin from the database and would start to encrypt the data using the algorithm RSA.  For data security and privacy issues, the fundamental challenge of separation of sensitive data (or raw data)and access control is fulfilled. The Cryptography technique translates original data that is the security pin into cipher which would be stored in the database.  This technique uses keys to translate data into unreadable form. So only authorized person can access the database. Cipher text data is visible for all people(even the hacker's xd and that is so apt to fool the hackers).
